1. Grammatical Errors:
   - The correct sentence should be: "I wanted to drink coffee yesterday."

2. Suggestions for Improvement:
   - The sentence should be in the past tense since it is referring to an action that was intended in the past but may not have happened. By changing "want" to "wanted" and "drunk" to "drink," the sentence will be grammatically correct.

3. Vocabulary Enhancement:
   - Consider using more descriptive language to enhance the sentence, such as: "Yesterday, I had a strong craving for a cup of coffee."

By making these adjustments, you can improve the clarity and correctness of your statement.
